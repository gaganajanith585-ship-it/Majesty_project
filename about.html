        <h2>About MAJESTY</h2>

        <p>MAJESTY is more than a clothing brand — it is a statement of confidence, elegance, and individuality. We
            believe
            what you wear should not only look good but also make you feel powerful, comfortable, and unapologetically
            yourself.
            <br><br>
            Born from a passion for quality craftsmanship and timeless style, MAJESTY was created to redefine everyday
            fashion with a premium touch. Each piece is thoughtfully designed to balance modern trends with lasting
            appeal,
            ensuring our collections remain relevant beyond seasons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>

        <p>MAJESTY began with a simple idea: to create clothing that feels as majestic as it looks. We saw a gap between
            style and comfort, and we decided to bridge it. What started as a vision has grown into a brand dedicated to
            delivering refined designs without compromising on quality or affordability.
            <br>
            Every design reflects our commitment to excellence — from fabric selection to final stitching.
